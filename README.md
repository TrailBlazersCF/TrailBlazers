### General Project Description
We will be recreating Oregon Trail game, based on the original game called The Oregon Trail, a computer game developed by the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC) in 1985.  In the game, the player assumes the role of a wagon leader guiding a party of settlers from Independence, Missouri, to Oregon's Willamette Valley via a covered wagon.  Along the way you will encounter obstacles, hunt, cross rivers, face sickness, and have to find/trade for food.
