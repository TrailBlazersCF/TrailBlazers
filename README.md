### General Project Description
We will be recreating Oregon Trail game, based on the original game called The Oregon Trail, a computer game developed by the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC) in 1985.  In the game, the player assumes the role of a wagon leader guiding a party of settlers from Independence, Missouri, to Oregon's Willamette Valley via a covered wagon.  Along the way you will encounter obstacles, hunt, cross rivers, face sickness, and have to find/trade for food.  

### Usage example
Oregon Trail game is perfect for anyone that want's to play a fun, but also educational, game. It would be great as a teaching tool for young children, to learn more about the history of the United States, and how challenging it was to go anywhere back in the 1840s
